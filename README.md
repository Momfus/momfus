### Oh! Hello there /*using young Obi-Wan's voice*/ 👋 


I'm **Momfus** (my glamorous nickname), who loves three things: videogames, programming, and cats. I graduated as a Systems Engineer from [UTN FRM](http://www.frm.utn.edu.ar/) (Mendoza's National Technology University from Argentina) and work mainly with Angular/JavaScript. Additionally, I take on projects under contract or in freelance mode.
