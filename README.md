### Oh! Hello there /*using young Obi-Wan's voice*/ 👋 


I'm **Momfus** (my glamorous nickname), and I have a passion for three things: video games, programming, and cats. I hold a degree in Systems Engineering from the National Technological University of Mendoza (UTN FRM) in Argentina. My professional expertise lies primarily in working with Angular and JavaScript. In addition to my main role, I also undertake contract and freelance projects.
